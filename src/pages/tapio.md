# Tapio: A Finnish Mythology-Inspired Multi-Agent System

## Introduction

Tapio is a multi-agent AI system designed to help immigrants navigate Finnish bureaucracy and essential services. Named after the Finnish forest god who provides wisdom and guidance, Tapio serves as both the overarching system and the primary orchestrator who directs users to specialized agents based on their needs.

Each agent within the Tapio system is named after a significant figure from Finnish mythology or cultural history, creating a cohesive system that honors Finland's rich heritage while providing practical assistance to newcomers.

## How The System Works

The Tapio system functions as a coordinated agency where:

2. **Specialized Agents** are activated based on the query's domain
3. **Seamless Transitions** occur between agents, with Tapio maintaining conversation context
4. **Consistent Voice** is maintained across all agents, following Finntegrate's clear, warm, and supportive tone
5. **Cultural Respect** is embedded in both the system design and the guidance provided

## Technical Implementation

From a technical perspective, the Tapio agency can be implemented as:

1. **Unified Backend with Routing Logic:** A single RAG system with specialized knowledge domains and agent personalities
2. **Distinct Agent Pipelines:** Separate but interconnected RAG systems for each specialized domain
3. **Contextual Memory:** A shared system that maintains user context across agent interactions
4. **Multilingual Support:** All agents communicate in the user's preferred language
5. **Specialized Knowledge Retrieval:** Each agent accesses domain-specific information sources (Migri, Kela, TE Services, etc.)

By embedding Finnish mythology and cultural references into the system architecture, Tapio creates an experience that's not only practical but also connects immigrants to Finland's rich cultural heritage from their first interactions with the country's systems.
